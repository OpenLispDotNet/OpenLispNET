OpenLisp.NET
v0.0.1
The Wizard & The Wyrd, LLC

Summary
=======
OpenLisp.NET is a tiny Clojure-like LISP written in C# and targeting the .NET platform.
The OpenLisp.Core library contains all datatypes, interfaces, classes, utility functions to parse OpenLisp S-Expressions.

Why another LISP?
=================
A valid question!  OpenLisp.NET is primarily an internal research project with the aims of writing a blazingly fast
LISP in managed code targeting .NET/CoreCLR.  Should the research prove fruitful, OpenLisp.NET may be used as an internal
scripting language, or as a standalone language.  Eventually, OpenLisp.NET should be able to emit IL assemblies.
